# About Buskin

### Problem

Busking is the act of performing music in public with the short term hope of earning tips from passerby and, for some, a long term goal of gaining attention and perhaps a following that leads to something more. In todayâ€™s increasingly cashless world, this short term goal is hindered by fewer passerby with money to tip, which makes sustaining the lifestyle harder and makes reaching the long term goal more difficult. And as cities become more crowded, so too grows the potential fighting for busking space amongst the busking community.

### How Buskin solves it

Buskin seeks to solve these problems by connecting artists to each other, to their fans, and providing a space for digitally seeking and receiving support. Both artists and fans can create profiles. Artists can then schedule and delete events and update their profile accordingly. Artists are also notified if an event they wish to schedule is 30 yards from another artist's performance at the same time, warns them, and, if they choose to schedule, notifies the other artist(s). Fans can follow and unfollow artists, save and delete events, and search for artists/events based on keywords.
